        <strong>APPLICATION INTEGRATION</strong>
        <p>
          The need for integrating applications is growing as a consequence of
          organizational demands and enabling technologies, in particular to the
          Web and enterprise software packages. A Consistent increase in need
          for B2B integration with different trading partners and other
          companies inside and outside the boundaries of any enterprise is
          observed because different companies use different business
          applications which vary depending upon languages & technologies used,
          hardware platforms on which they run and operating Systems having
          inconsistent user interfaces which in turn result in isolated
          functionality, multiple instances of the same data, redundant manual
          activities, higher costs and inefficient responses to customers. In
          order to overcome the problems of a functional organization, Ammadar
          has been concentrating on business processes, which are connected
          activities that create value for the customers. These processes cross
          the internal borders of an organization as well as the external
          borders to other organizations, thereby supporting supplier and
          customer relationship management, virtual enterprises, and extended
          supply chain management.
